    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Indulge your taste buds in the rich and aromatic flavors of our Creamy Butter Chicken recipe. This beloved classic from the heart of Indian cuisine is a symphony of tender, marinated chicken pieces bathed in a luscious, velvety tomato-based sauce. Every bite is a harmonious blend of warm spices, creamy butter, and the essence of smoky tandoor-grilled chicken.</p>

        <p>To prepare this delectable dish, succulent chicken pieces are first marinated in a tantalizing mixture of yogurt, ginger, garlic, and a medley of Indian spices. This marinade infuses the meat with a depth of flavor and ensures each bite is juicy and flavorful.</p>
        
        <p>The pièce de résistance of this dish is the buttery tomato sauce. Fresh tomatoes are simmered to perfection, their natural sweetness enhanced by aromatic spices such as cumin, coriander, and garam masala. As the sauce bubbles away, it absorbs the richness of butter, cream, and a hint of honey, resulting in a luxurious, velvety texture that's both indulgent and comforting.</p>
