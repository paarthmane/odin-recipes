    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        Butter Roti, also known as "Butter Naan," is a quintessential Indian flatbread that holds a special place in the hearts and palates of people around the world. This soft, pillowy bread, enriched with the richness of butter, is a comforting and versatile staple in Indian cuisine.

        The preparation of Butter Roti begins with a simple mixture of whole wheat flour, water, and a pinch of salt. The dough is kneaded to perfection, resulting in a smooth and elastic texture that allows for effortless rolling and cooking. Each portion of the dough is skillfully shaped into round discs, and then comes the magic â€“ butter.

        Once on the hot griddle, these rotis are lightly coated with glistening butter, which not only enhances the flavor but also gives them a beautiful golden sheen. The aroma of cooking Butter Roti wafts through the air, promising a delightful meal to come.
